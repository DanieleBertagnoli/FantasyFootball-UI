# FantasyFootballBidManager âš½
This tool can be used to manage the bids for the famous Italian game "Fantacalcio," also known as "Fantasy Football." It's a simple yet useful web interface that helps you keep track of all participants' credits and events during the bidding process.

## Installation ðŸš€
The tool requires a Python3 virtual environment to work (you can also choose to install Flask on your PC). First of all, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DanieleBertagnoli/FantasyFootballBidManager
```

After that run the installation script:

```sh
sudo chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## Usage ðŸ‘¾
This tool uses Python's library named Flask to run a local server on your device. Once the server.py is started, you can use the tool by connecting to the standard address 127.0.0.1:5000. You can start a new bid or resume an already started bid by selecting the file saved by the tool.

The final file will be saved and stored in the "Uploads" folder, located in the same directory as the server.py file.

To run the web interface, simply use the following commands:

```sh
sudo chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
